# Get direct link from gif image in google drive and insert to markdown
Being in G+ and using Google Docs and Google Drive I already knew that I could share files between other Google users but I wasn't sure if I could really directly link my files(hotlink).
Finding a workaround for direct linking my files in Google Drive would mean that I could upload my animated GIF's there and then hotlink them to my CodeCanyon plugins saving bandwidth.

After searching a bit I did find a solution, you can read it below and use it as well!

First of all you must upload the file you want to hotlink and make sure its shared as Public. Then go and copy the share link that Google provides for the file. This should be something like:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_FILE_ID/edit?usp=sharing
Copy "YOUR_FILE_ID" and paste it at the end of the following url replacing "YOUR_FILE_ID":
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID

This will be the direct link to your file hosted in Google Drive, you can use it to download the file directly to your pc or hotlink it to your website/blog.
